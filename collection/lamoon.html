	<h1> lamoon </h1>

	<p> This doll is Bunnycorn Lamoon and she is a creation of the artist Villitunes and she is to date my most recent doll and the doll that I am most excited about because I have been waiting a very long time for this artist to come out with her! She does not have a character but her name is Mugwhy. The photos that were taken were taken by the artist herself!</p>
