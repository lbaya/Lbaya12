	<h1> bobo </h1>
     <p>
     Bobo is a doll that is made by the artist lillycat and is one of my latest dolls at the momtent. I purchased her on an impulse but I have a strong feeling that I will end up loving her alot! I do not have an assigned character to her but all I know as of yet is that her name is Ophelia! She has not yet arrived to my house as I am still paying her off and I would like to pay her off by the start of next year! The photos were taken by the previous owner that sold her to me! </p>
