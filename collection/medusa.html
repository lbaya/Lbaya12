	<h1> medusa </h1>

	<p>
     This doll is a Doll chateau Medusa, which I have recieved about two months ago. She does not have a set character but does have a name which is Clam. Unfortunately I have sold her in order to obtain christmas money but that is okay because I did not grow attatched to her.
