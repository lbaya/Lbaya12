	<h1> loonette </h1>
    <p>
     Loonette is from the artist lillycat and is one of my older dolls. I did not get her directly from the artist as she is a second hand doll. I have no clue how many owners shes had but that is none of my concern. I love her so much and I would never sell her, well maybe not. Her name is November which is the month that I was born on.
