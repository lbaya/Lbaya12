  <h1>Heating</h1>
  <P>
Remember that enclosures must allow for a proper thermal gradient that the ball python can utilize, with a hotspot on one end of the enclosure and a cool spot on the other. Provide your ball python with a basking spot temperature of 88 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit and an ambient temperature of 78 to 80 degrees. The ambient temperature should not fall below 75 degrees. It is vitally important to know the temperatures at which you are keeping your snake(s). Do not guess! A great way to monitor temperatures is to use a digital indoor/outdoor thermometer with a probe, such as the Zoo Med Digital Thermometer. Stick the thermometer to the inside of the cage on the cool end and place the probe on the warm end, and you'll have both sides covered at <a href="substrate.html">once</a>.</P>
