3.       Hover over "pixels" then click until you see options, click on the option that says "inches"

4.       Now delete whatever number is seen on the "width" and "height" boxes and type "6" for both so we should come out with a square.

5.       Now press "create" at the very bottom.

6.       On the left of the screen you should see a tool bar, click on the eighth tool down, it should look like an empty square/ rectangle.

7.       Once you have selected this tool, go to the center of the page and drag the square out until you see that the "w" is 3.76 and the "h" is 3.25.

8.       Then click the selection tool, which is the very first tool in the toolbar.

9.       Now move the shape you have created to roughly the center by dragging it to the coordinates that read "dX: 0.14in/dY: 0in" then leave it.

10.   Now we are going to go back to the rectangle tool but this time, right click until you see other shaped tools, select the "Ellipse tool"

11.   Enlarge the ellipse until it the height and width say "W: 2.97/ H: 2.97"

12.   Then click the selection tool.
